Vite Project Setup with Redux Toolkit
This is a sample project setup guide for creating a Vite project with Redux Toolkit for state management.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash

git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies:


npm install
Running the Project
To run the project locally, use the following command:


npm run dev
This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

Adding Redux Toolkit
Install the necessary packages:


npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
Create your Redux slice (e.g., src/components/Slices/todoSlice.js) with the Redux actions, reducers, and initial state.

Set up your Redux store using configureStore.

Use the Redux Provider in your root component to wrap your application with the Redux store.

Components
TodoForm
The TodoForm component allows users to add new todos to the list. It includes an input field for entering todo text and a button to submit the new task.

Todo
The Todo component displays the list of todos. It provides functionality to complete tasks, delete tasks, and edit tasks. It also includes styling for different states of todos.
